### A Programming Journal using [Zola](https://getzola.com) , a static site generator developed in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)

#### No dependencies
Zola comes as a single executable with Sass compilation, syntax highlighting, table of contents and many other features that 
traditionally require setting up a dev environment or adding some JavaScript libraries to your site.

#### Blazing fast
The average site will be generated in less than a second, including Sass compilation and syntax highlighting.

#### Scalable
Zola renders your whole site as static files, making it trivial to handle any kind of traffic you will throw at it at no cost without 
having to worry about managing a server or a database.
